**SPRINGFIELD, Tenn**. – August 14, 2024 – _Inc_. announced that S3 Recycling Solutions ranks No. 4077 on the 2024 Inc. 5000, its annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses.

S3 has appeared on the list every year since 2021, and this year the electronics recycler ranks #69 among Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin companies, #107 in Tennessee, and #477 in business products and services in America.

“2024 has been a year filled with ‘wins’ for our team,” S3 CEO Rod McDaniel said. “We expanded our delivery capabilities with a California-based [acquisition](https://s3rs.com/2024/07/acquisition/), we celebrated an amazing company culture when we were named a [Best Place to Work](https://s3rs.com/2024/04/best-place-to-work/), and now we are being recognized for our continued growth and success. I am exceptionally proud of our team and humbled to lead such a great group of hard-working professionals.”

The Inc. 5000 class of 2024 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year’s top 500 companies, the average median three-year revenue growth rate is 1,637 percent. In all, this year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three years. Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, Patagonia, and many other household-name brands gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.

For complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, location, and other criteria, go to [www.inc.com/inc5000](http://www.inc.com/inc5000). All 5,000 companies are featured on Inc.com, and the top 500 appear in the new issue of Inc. magazine, available on newsstands beginning Tuesday, August 20.

“One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list,” says Mike Hofman, who recently joined Inc. as editor-in-chief. “To see all of the intriguing and surprising ways that companies are transforming sectors, from health care and AI to apparel and pet food, is fascinating for me as a journalist and storyteller. Congratulations to this year’s honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce.”

S3 serves more than 300 clients across North America and is on a historical growth trajectory. Last summer it purchased a building in Springfield, Tenn., adding 78,000 square feet of warehouse space to its real estate portfolio. Also, S3 and its leadership consistently receive local, regional and national recognition including Ernst & Young LLP (EY US) named McDaniel an [Entrepreneur of the Year](https://s3rs.com/2024/06/entrepreneur-of-the-year/) ® 2024 Southeast Award winner.
