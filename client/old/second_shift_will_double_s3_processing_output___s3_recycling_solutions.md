# Second Shift Will Double S3 Processing Output

![](https://s3rs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/second-shift-blog.jpg)

S3 Recycling Solutions, an Inc. 5000 fastest-growing private company, is launching a second shift at its 75,000 square foot electronics recycling facility in Springfield, Tenn. The additional operating hours are expected to add 15 jobs over the next 12 months.

Increased demand for e-waste solutions is driving the expansion. Information technology equipment management and data-bearing device security are becoming critical business components.

“With the recent uptick in hacks and data security breaches, many companies are putting more emphasis on physical destruction of hard drives and data wiping,” said Rod McDaniel, S3’s chief executive officer. “A second shift will allow us to process an additional 20,000 devices every month.”

When moving its operations to Springfield, Tenn. in 2018, S3 exceeded its projections of adding 25 jobs. The company expects to see similar growth next year.

“We are excited to create more employment opportunities for the Middle Tennessee community, while also providing our clients with enhanced services to meet their quickly-growing electronics asset management requirements,” McDaniel said.

S3 will begin accepting applications immediately for sorters, freight handlers and data entry techs. Interested candidates can apply at [s3rs.ninjagig.com](https://s3rs.ninjagig.com/). The second shift is expected to be fully online in Q1 2022.

“This will hopefully be another avenue to recruit and retain new team members to our firm,” S3 Chairman Darrell S. Freeman, Sr. said. “We recently increased our wages to be more competitive, and we pay 100 percent of our employees’ health care benefits. We understand the importance of having a healthy and happy workforce, and we strive to create a culture where everyone feels valued.”

In 2021, S3 was listed as one of America’s fastest growing private companies by Inc. Magazine. McDaniel was also named one of Nashville Business Journal’s Most Admired CEOs.
