# Services

## Complete E-Waste Solutions

S3’s comprehensive electronics recycling services can be broken down into three simple categories:

- [information technology asset disposition](https://s3rs.com/services/itad/)
- [data destruction](https://s3rs.com/services/data-destruction/) and
- [end-of-life recycling](https://s3rs.com/services/end-of-life-recycling/).

All three of these services work together to form a complete e-waste program for your business. You may need all of them or just a portion of one. With one call to our team, we will determine which of these services best fit your needs.

### End-of-Life Recycling

Because of S3’s commitment to sustainable solutions, our first priority is to resale and reuse as many devices as possible. Equipment that has no resale value, is antiquated or beyond repair is demanufactured in accordance to local state and federal environmental laws and regulations.
