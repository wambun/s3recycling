### Our Commitment To Environmental Stewardship

Because of S3’s commitment to sustainable solutions, our first priority is to resale and reuse as many devices as possible. After that, we follow a standard downstream recycling process with our partners that ensures no environmental laws or regulations are violated.

## Our End-of-Life Promise

S3’s commitment to sustainable solutions ensures that we execute proper disposal of all devices and equipment at the end of their life cycle. Equipment that has no resale value, is antiquated or beyond repair is demanufactured in accordance to local state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Our full process follows a Zero Landfill trajectory from receiving to end-of-life.

### Zero Landfill Policy

Global e-waste is a threat to the environment because toxic chemicals contained in electronics are potential pollutants that could find their way in our soil and air sources. S3 measures the amount of e-waste it diverts from local landfills each year.

### ISO 14001

The International Organization for Standardization issues the ISO 14001:2015 certification to an organization seeking to manage its environmental responsibilities in a systematic manner that contributes to the environmental pillar of sustainability.

### Downstream Partners

S3 partners with other certified recyclers to ensure that any unusable materials received in our warehouse are properly recycled or destroyed.
