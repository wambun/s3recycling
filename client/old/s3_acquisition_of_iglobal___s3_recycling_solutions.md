**SPRINGFIELD, Tenn**. – S3 Recycling Solutions today announced that it has acquired iGlobal Asset Management, a California-based leader in information technology asset disposition (ITAD) and medical asset disposition. Effective July 1, 2024, the West Coast operation serves as S3’s first location outside of Tennessee.

This is S3’s first acquisition under current CEO Rod McDaniel. The purchase increases S3’s employee headcount by approximately 17 percent, increases annual revenue by 10 percent, and brings its number of facilities to three, totaling over 200,000 square feet.

“This acquisition marks a significant milestone for our organization, and it is one component of a strategic five-year plan that the S3 Board is implementing,” McDaniel said. “iGlobal was the right fit for our overall mission. We will leverage its specialty in medical asset resale, which is a S3 service offering that is quickly growing. And, we now have a facility on the West Coast that will be an integral part of expanding our capabilities. S3’s national reach, combined with iGlobal’s regional expertise, ensures that clients will benefit from an enhanced service experience. We are excited to welcome the iGlobal team and all its stakeholders to the S3 family.”

S3 serves more than 300 clients across North America and is on a historical growth trajectory. Last summer it purchased a building in Springfield, Tenn., adding [78,000 square feet of warehouse space](https://s3rs.com/2023/06/s3-buys-78000-sf-warehouse-hires-coo/) to its real estate portfolio. Also, S3 and its leadership consistently receive local, regional and national recognition. Inc. Magazine has named S3 one of the fastest-growing private companies in America for four consecutive years; Nashville Business Journal named S3 a Best Place to Work for multiple years; and Ernst & Young LLP (EY US) named McDaniel an [Entrepreneur of the Year® 2024 Southeast Award winner](https://www.ey.com/en_us/entrepreneur-of-the-year-us/southeast/overview).

“S3 Recycling Solutions’ values and culture made me feel comfortable entrusting my company to them,” Shahin Joudat, Owner and CEO of iGlobal Asset Management said. “Rod’s vision for the future of the company ensures that iGlobal will reach its fullest potential.”

Both S3 and iGlobal share a commitment to promoting sustainable practices in asset disposition. This acquisition allows S3 to further its mission of reducing environmental impact while maximizing the value of retired IT and medical assets. With S3’s certifications in R2, ISO 9001, 14001, and 45001, clients can expect continued service with the highest standards in data security and environmental management.
