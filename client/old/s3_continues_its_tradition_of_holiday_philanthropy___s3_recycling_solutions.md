# S3 Continues its Tradition of Holiday Philanthropy

![](https://s3rs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rayna.jpg)

The S3 team continued its tradition of philanthropy and holiday giving this week. During a year that presented so many challenges, it was our honor to give back to the local Springfield community. We partnered with [Kiwanis of Springfield](https://www.facebook.com/kiwanisofspringfieldtn/) to shop for 20 families for Christmas. The video below is a great recap of our outing. We wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season!
