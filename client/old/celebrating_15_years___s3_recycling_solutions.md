# Celebrating 15 Years

## Our History

Throughout the years, we’ve focused on creating a sustainable organization; one that not only safeguards the

environment, but also withstands the test of time. We’re grateful to celebrate the milestone of operating for 15

years, attracting the best talent to our team and becoming an industry leader.

From The Great Recession that began in 2007 to the global pandemic of 2020, S3 has successfully created hundreds of jobs, supported families throughout the country, and contributed time, finances and resources to the community.

## $15K For 15 Years

#### Education is a fundamental building block of a vital and progressive society. It was also a passion of our immediate past Chairman Darrell S. Freeman, Sr. who believed that education is the great equalizer that opens the door of opportunity to everyone. In his memory – and in celebration of S3’s 15 years in business – we will reward three students with $5,000 scholarships.

#### The Darrell S. Freeman, Sr. scholarship is open to college and university students across Tennessee. It will be awarded to students who have demonstrated the desire to pursue their educations, but are facing financial barriers to completing school.

#### We are seeking nominations from our community for students to be considered for these scholarships. If you would like to submit a nomination, please send an email to scholars@s3rs.com with the student’s name, phone number, email address and description of why the student is deserving of the scholarship. We ask that all nominations are are submitted by June 15, 2023, and final recipients will be announced by July 15, 2023.
