**SPRINGFIELD, Tenn**. – S3 Recycling Solutions today announced that it has named Nathan Freeman as its director of business development. As the youngest sales executive in S3’s history, Freeman successfully grew active and prospective clients by 35 percent after [joining the Middle Tennessee-based electronics recycling firm](https://s3rs.com/2022/10/the-legacy-of-darrell-s-freeman-sr/) full time in the Summer of 2022.

As director of business development, Freeman will lead a team of executives who are responsible for creating new business opportunities for S3 throughout the U.S and Canada.

Along with a successful tenure as a S3 sales executive, Freeman spent the last year elevating his executive profile in the Middle Tennessee community. He currently serves on the board of Rotaract of Nashville, a service club for young professionals; he is a board member at the [Tennessee Environmental Council](https://www.tectn.org/), is on the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce YP Council, and he is a 2023 graduate of the Greater Nashville Technology Council’s Emerging Leaders in Tech (ELITE) program, a three-month program for aspiring and new leaders in the tech industry.

“Nathan has quickly excelled to become one of S3’s most exceptional sales team members. His work ethic and his desire to be a continual learner are the driving forces behind his success at S3 and in the community,” said S3 CEO Rod McDaniel. “Watching him develop as a business professional and as a community leader makes me proud, and I look forward to the impact he will have on the S3 team and the city of Nashville.”

A native of Middle Tennessee, Freeman graduated from the University of Tennessee Knoxville where he studied business management with a collateral in entrepreneurship at the Haslam College of Business. He began his tenure in the electronics recycling industry by interning with S3 as a warehouse worker in the summer of 2018, and he spent subsequent summers working with the firm.

“I’m grateful for the opportunity to launch and grow my career at an organization like S3,” Freeman said. “Not only is it a great place to apply my business management training, but it is an environment that encourages personal growth as well. It is my honor to work alongside a team of seasoned professionals at a thriving company that is making an impact at the local and national level. Being the director of business development is a great chance for me to contribute to S3’s bottom line and its expansion across the country. I’m ready for the challenge and I couldn’t be more excited about it.”
