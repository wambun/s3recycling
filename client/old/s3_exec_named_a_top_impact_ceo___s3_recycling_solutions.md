**SPRINGFIELD, Tenn**. – January 16, 2026 – S3 announced that its CEO, [Rod McDaniel](https://s3rs.com/rod-mcdaniel/), has been named to The 2026 MO 100 Top Impact CEOs list, an annual recognition that celebrates CEOs around the country for their leadership, vision, and influence.

![](https://s3rs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rod-300x300.jpg)Presented by Big Path Capital, the MO 100 is meant to shine a spotlight on CEOs who are catalysts and agents of change driving the most dynamic segment of the economy. MO 100 Top Impact CEOs “champion a new vision of capitalism, demonstrating that every transaction represents an opportunity to create positive outcomes for all stakeholders.”

“I’m honored to be included among CEOs who are being recognized for driving meaningful social and environmental progress through the companies they lead,” McDaniel said. “S3’s core [values](https://s3rs.com/values/) of Dependability, Integrity, Community and Sustainability align perfectly with the mission of the MO 100 which is committed to building a regenerative economy that serves both people and the planet. I look forward to future collaboration with and learning from other honorees who make up a dynamic community of forward-thinking leaders.”

The MO 100 Top Impact CEO Ranking celebrates leaders who are leveraging the engine of capitalism to create shared prosperity. Companies who have been recognized in the MO 100 include household names such as Seventh Generation, Traditional Medicinals, Patagonia, and Vital Farms.

The 2026 MO Summit will take place March 16 – 18 in Asheville, NC, where an award ceremony and dinner will take place to celebrate all honorees. The Summit is a learning event where CEOs can connect and develop meaningful relationships.
