SPRINGFIELD, Tenn. – S3 Recycling Solutions and Information Technology Senior Management Forum (ITSMF) today announced that S3 has become ITSMF’s exclusive IT recycling partner.

S3 is an R2-certified electronics recycling firm headquartered in Springfield, Tennessee, with operations throughout the country. ITSMF, an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization, increases the representation of black professionals at senior levels in technology through enrichment of the mind, body and soul. S3 will assist ITSMF with responsibly recycling its organization’s laptops, desktops and other devices.

In addition to an e-recycling agreement, the two organizations plan to collaborate on other initiatives. S3 will make financial investments into ITSMF partnerships, and S3’s CEO Rod McDaniel will participate in ITSMF’s Management Academy, a nine-month developmental and educational program designed for middle management professionals.

“I am excited to form a partnership with an organization that is helping train and inspire the next generation of C-suite leaders in the IT space,” said Darrell S. Freeman, Sr. who is majority owner of S3 and has been a long-time ITSMF member. “By partnering with a premier organization that has tremendously diverse IT talent, we hope to demonstrate to others the possibilities of entrepreneurship and wealth creation.”

Formed in 1996, ITSMF is a national organization dedicated exclusively to cultivating executive talent among black technology professionals. The organization’s vision is to facilitate the creation of barrier-free opportunities for black technology influencers, innovators and leaders.

“We look forward to a dynamic and productive relationship with S3 Recycling Solutions and its leadership team,” said Viola Maxwell-Thompson, ITSMF president and CEO. “Partnerships like this one align with our mission and vision because they believe in the power of education and professional development, as well as advocating for a diverse, inclusive and equitable workplace.”
