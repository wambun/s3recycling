## Committed to Character and Community

Here at S3, we are proud of our work and how it gets done. All of our employees exhibit our company values through their attitudes and actions, whether it is in response to a client’s needs or a situation in the workplace. We work together to ensure that each clients’ requests are met in a timely, efficient manner.

In doing so, we are transparent about our process and its impact on the environment. Employees are held to the highest standards of integrity, and we do all that we can to give back through service and donations. S3’s four core values – dependability, sustainability, integrity and community – are described below.

## Our Values

#### [Dependability](https://s3rs.com/values/\#a44c9fb3b771d657e)

We always get the work done at the highest level. At S3, it is important that our clients trust us to handle their e-waste securely and efficiently. We hold ourselves to the highest professional, technical, and environmental standards in the industry in order to serve our clients at the highest level.

#### [Sustainability](https://s3rs.com/values/\#73641b961c2b96629)

We are doing our part to protect the environment. Without trustworthy processes from companies like S3, disposal of electronics is extremely harmful to the environment. In this age of advancement, it is absolutely necessary that businesses across all industries can depend on S3 to properly dispose of e-waste.

#### [Integrity](https://s3rs.com/values/\#011f33d8af9cce665)

We maintain transparency, communication, and commitment to the client’s goal. E-recycling is an inherently private business, as S3 handles all kinds of sensitive data. Transparency and communication are vital to building authentic relationships with clients. We want you to feel comfortable letting us into your workspace in order to handle your business’s e-waste.

#### [Community](https://s3rs.com/values/\#352a922099fb25f2e)

S3 feels like family and serves the broader community. S3 wants its employees to feel proud of their contributions to the company’s goals. Everyone shares in S3’s successes, and we continue to strive for more. We are also eager to give back to our local and national communities and expand our capacity to do so.
