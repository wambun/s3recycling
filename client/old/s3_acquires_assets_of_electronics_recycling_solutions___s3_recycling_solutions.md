# S3 Acquires Assets of Local Electronics Recycler

**SPRINGFIELD**, Tenn. – S3 Recycling Solutions, a national leader in IT asset disposition (ITAD) and electronics recycling, has purchased the assets of Gallatin, Tenn.-based Electronics Recycling Solutions (ERS). The acquisition comes as ERS closed its business after five years of operating as a non-profit.

ERS provided similar services to business customers as S3, so its equipment and assets are expected to seamlessly integrate into S3’s warehouse and logistics operations. In addition to the similarities in tangible property between the two companies, there is also another unique connection. Both organizations have provided employment for adults with autism and other disabilities.

ERS provided on-the-job training and meaningful work opportunities for those who are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and neurodiverse individuals. S3 also has an Autism Employment Program that provides a structured and supportive workplace, and the program is led by Stephen Polkowski, who has been diagnosed with autism.

“While ERS is moving out of the marketplace, its customers can feel good about the fact that S3 is a good alternative that can serve their organizations with responsible and compassionate ways to manage access electronics,” S3 CEO Rod McDaniel said. “My goal as a CEO is to create a work environment where everyone feels valued, and we all work together to provide excellent customer service while maintaining an inclusive company culture.”

S3 has been recognized by the Nashville Business Journal as a Best Place to Work, a nod to its successful employment programs and culture. Its business success has also been consistently recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of America’s fastest-growing private companies.
