# S3 Ranks on the 2025 INC List

![](https://s3rs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-2.jpg)

**SPRINGFIELD, Tenn**. – August 12, 2025 – _Inc_., a media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that S3 Recycling Solutions is No. 2,865 on its annual Inc. 5000 list, a ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

“I am humbled to lead a team of professionals at S3 where our growth trajectory is routinely recognized on the local and national level,” S3 CEO Rod McDaniel said. “We have ranked on the Inc. 5000 list for five consecutive years, and we’re excited to be recognized alongside some of the nation’s most successful companies. We share this honor with our customers and friends who have supported our growth over the years, and it is a top priority for me to maintain our quality of services and our company culture as we grow.”

This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

_Inc._ will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.

S3’s three-year growth was 145 percent and included accomplishments such as: successfully completing its first company [acquisition](https://s3rs.com/2024/07/acquisition/), expanding its capabilities to California; adding [78,000 square feet](https://s3rs.com/2023/06/s3-buys-78000-sf-warehouse-hires-coo/) of warehouse space to its real estate portfolio; and most recently completing a 2025 acquisition of [assets](https://s3rs.com/2025/03/s3-acquires-assets/) of a local electronics recycler.

**Methodology**

Companies on the 2025 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2021 to 2024. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2021. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2024. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2021 is $100,000; the minimum for 2024 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons.
