# S3 Named An Inc. 5000 Fastest-Growing Company

![](https://s3rs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Inc-5000.jpg)

Inc. magazine today revealed that S3 Recycling Solutions is on its annual Inc. 5000 list, a prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies. S3 makes the list for the first time after achieving a three-year revenue growth of 248 percent.

“This is a huge milestone for our organization,” said S3 CEO Rod McDaniel. “It’s another indicator that we believe we’re headed in the right direction. Our hard work and dedication to customer service is paying off and we’re motivated – now more than ever – to keep improving, continue growing and steadily increase our positive impact on the environment and our community.”

As an electronics recycler based in Springfield, Tenn., S3 employs 25 people in its 75,000 square foot warehouse.

The Inc. 5000 list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent small businesses. Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.

Not only have the companies on the 2021 Inc. 5000 been very competitive within their markets, but this year’s list also proved especially resilient and flexible given 2020’s unprecedented challenges. Among the 5,000, the average median three-year growth rate soared to 543 percent, and median revenue reached $11.1 million. Together, those companies added more than 610,000 jobs over the past three years.

Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at [www.inc.com/inc500](http://www.inc.com/inc500)

“The 2021 Inc. 5000 list feels like one of the most important rosters of companies ever compiled,” says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. “Building one of the fastest-growing companies in America in any year is a remarkable achievement. Building one in the crisis we’ve lived through is just plain amazing. This kind of accomplishment comes with hard work, smart pivots, great leadership, and the help of a whole lot of people.”
