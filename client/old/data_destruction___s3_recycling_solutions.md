## Hard Drive Shredding

With global upticks in hacks and data security breaches, many companies are putting emphasis on physical destruction of hard drives and other media storage devices. S3’s high-performance hard drive shredders provide increased efficiency and security to our clients, including onsite data destruction services.

## What S3 Offers

### Secure Facilities

When a data destruction project requires offsite processes, clients can be sure that S3’s multilevel security continues to protect their sensitive data. S3 provides a secure chain of custody during the relocation of clients’ data-containing devices, and their offsite facilities are monitored 24/7. On top of constant CCTV monitoring, facilities have armed guards on both shifts, RFID badge access to data sensitive areas, third party monitoring, and security gates on dock doors.

### Overwriting/Wiping

Overwriting, or wiping, is a software procedure that performs a multiple pass wipe and replacement of previously stored data on magnetic media with predefined meaningless data. S3 only utilizes software that meets the industry’s accepted standard. Security and compliance are guaranteed throughout S3’s data and equipment destruction process, and all drives in our possession are wiped using Active KillDisk.

### Physical Destruction

S3 conducts HD shredding for physical destruction of data storage devices including (but not limited to) hard drives, CDs, DVDs, cellular phones, PDAs, routers, switches, VPNs, firewalls, copy machines, fax machines, phone system voicemail, printers, cassettes, and flash memory devices. All media are either sanitized or completely destroyed in accordance to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST®) 800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization.

### Robust Reporting

S3 provides proof of successful erasure and non-recoverability – (certification of destruction), as required by industry regulations. Our detailed audit reports meet and exceed all regulatory and compliance requirements for data erasure.

### R2 Certified Process

S3 is an R2 certified firm, which means that we consistently elect to use the best, most sustainable processes available when dealing with e-waste. This applies to all of our work, from client and community relations to the physical recycling or end-of-life disposal of electronic waste. By choosing S3, clients are choosing sustainability.

### Onsite Data Destruction

With the capability to shred 2,000 drives in an hour, S3’s AMS-2000 mobile hard drive shredder allows for quick and effective onsite data destruction. No matter the client’s work environment or project situation, S3 can come to you. Tens of thousands of hard drives can be sanitized and shredded in one workday, with the added benefit of knowing your sensitive data never left your site.
