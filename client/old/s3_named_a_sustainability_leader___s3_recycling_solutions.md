**SPRINGFIELD, Tenn**. – [The Orange County Business Journal](https://www.ocbj.com/custom-content/leaders-in-sustainability-2024/) recognized S3 Recycling Solutions this week in its special report on Leaders in Sustainability. The report highlighted organizations that are a “positive example for what it means to be a socially conscious organization in 2024.” The list included companies that are committed to environmental stewardship and long-term economic growth.

“We appreciate the OCBJ for shining a spotlight on this subject,” said S3 CEO Rod McDaniel. “We’re honored that our S3 West location in California is receiving this recognition, and we’re glad to be considered a leader in sustainability. It feels good to know that our commitment to recycling and building a greener future is appreciated, and we hope to inspire other organizations to incorporate positive environmental measures into their operations.”

This is one of the first times S3 West has been recognized since the [acquisition of the California location](https://s3rs.com/2024/07/acquisition/) was completed this summer.  The other 17 organizations that made the list of sustainability leaders include businesses from various industries such as aviation, manufacturing, architecture and healthcare. The full report can be viewed [here](https://ocbj.wppcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Leaders-Sustainability-11.11.24.pdf).

This recognition adds to S3’s growing lists of accolades in 2024 which include being [ranked on the Inc. 5000](https://s3rs.com/2024/08/s3-ranks-on-the-2024-inc-list/) list of fastest-growing private companies in America, being [named a Best Place to Work](https://s3rs.com/2024/04/best-place-to-work/), and McDaniel being [named an Entrepreneur Of The Year](https://s3rs.com/2024/06/entrepreneur-of-the-year/).
