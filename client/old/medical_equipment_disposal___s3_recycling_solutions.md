# Medical Equipment Disposal

Lab Asset Management

### Security. Sustainability. Stewardship.

Headquartered in the nation’s healthcare capital, S3 maximizes the resale revenue and minimizes the environmental impact of surplus lab and medical equipment, some of which is donated to communities where funds are limited. Our processes and procedures are fully HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant, as we serve some of the largest healthcare companies in the nation.

**Liquidation Made Simple**

Headquartered in the nation’s healthcare capital, S3 maximizes the end-of-life value and minimizes the environmental impact of businesses’ medical equipment disposal. Whether it’s a small medical office or a large hospital needing liquidation, S3 can handle it. We manage all of the logistics, and our technicians offer data security and complete de-installations with no hidden cost of retrieval.

**Data Security**

S3 is DOTmed certified, which indicates that we use the best practices for safe and secure disposal of unwanted medical equipment. We complete thorough inventory and other reports, and we maintain a strict chain-of-custody when data and equipment is relocated to our facilities for disposal. We also surpass all data-wiping standards and privacy laws, so clients can be sure that all data is securely handled throughout the entire process. Comprehensive reporting and around-the-clock security at S3 facilities keeps us accountable to clients and ourselves.
