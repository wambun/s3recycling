**NASHVILLE, Tenn**., – Nashville Business Journal has named S3 Recycling Solutions to its 2024 list of a Best Place to Work. This is the third time the electronics recycling organization has appeared on the coveted list of Middle Tennessee work places. The list recognizes companies with positive work environments, leadership that inspires their teams, and places where employees can have fun while being successful in business.

“Creating an environment at S3 where every team member feels appreciated and respected is an all-around win for everyone,” S3 CEO Rod McDaniel said. “When employees know they are valued as people first – and profits come second – then morale increases, they are more invested in the organization and they are proud to call S3 their workplace. We love that, and we strive to maintain a culture where team members have the organization’s full support to be happy while providing a healthy lifestyle for themselves and their families.”

Below are a few of S3’s responses to the NBJ Best Places to Work survey.

**A dying workplace skill we’d bring back**:

Initiative.

**Our workplace anthem**:

“Eye of the Tiger.” Our company was started by Rod McDaniel, who started his life with a single mom in the projects. He had big hopes and dreams for his future and never gave up. We wouldn’t be who we are today without Rod McDaniel’s vision, leadership and unwavering dedication to achievement. As we say at the end of each meeting, “Nothing Shall be Impossible.”

**Our most unique employee benefit:**

Weekly catered lunch and monthly catered breakfast.

**How do you help your employees manage stress?**

A few ways. Our HR department has an open-door policy. Employees know they can come to HR and discuss their concerns whether that’s work or personal. HR and the director of warehouse operations check in daily on all employees. “How are you?” “Do you need anything?” — We’re always a listening ear and provide daily support. We also offer all employees an Employee Assistance Program.
