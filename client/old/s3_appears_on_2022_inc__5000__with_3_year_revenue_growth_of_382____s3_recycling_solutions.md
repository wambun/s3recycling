# S3 Appears on 2022 Inc. 5000, With 3-Year Revenue Growth of 382%

**SPRINGFIELD**, Tenn. – August 16, 2022 – Today, S3 Recycling Solutions announced that it has been named to _Inc. Magazine’s_ annual Inc. 5000 list, a prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. This marks the second consecutive year that S3 has been named to the list, and it celebrates the company’s 382 percent growth rate over the last three years.

“It’s an honor to be included on the Inc. 5000 list for a consecutive year,” said Rod McDaniel, S3 president and CEO. “Our expansion of service lines and business development activities has propelled our continued growth. I give major credit to our team members, our positive company culture and amazing clients and partners for this accomplishment.”

The companies on the 2022 Inc. 5000 have not only been successful, but have also demonstrated resilience amid supply chain woes, labor shortages, and the ongoing impact of Covid-19. Among the top 500, the average median three-year revenue growth rate soared to 2,144 percent. Together, those companies added more than 68,394 jobs over the past three years.

Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at [www.inc.com/inc5000](https://www.inc.com/inc5000). This list represents a one-of-a-kind look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent businesses. Facebook, Chobani, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.

“The accomplishment of building one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S., in light of recent economic roadblocks, cannot be overstated,” says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. “Inc. is thrilled to honor the companies that have established themselves through innovation, hard work, and rising to the challenges of today.”

S3 Recycling Solutions was also named a 2022 Best Places to Work honoree by Nashville Business Journal, and is on track for record revenue in 2022.

“S3’s steady growth and increased national recognition is a testament to its position as a leader in the information technology asset disposition industry,” McDaniel said.

**Methodology**

Companies on the 2022 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2018 to 2021. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2018. They must be U.S. based, privately held, for profit, and independent – not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies — as of December 31, 2021. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2018 is $100,000; the minimum for 2021 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to four decimal places. The top 500 companies on the Inc. 5000 are featured in Inc. magazine’s September issue.
