Recognized with honors like EY Entrepreneur of the Year and Nashville Business Journal’s Most Admired CEO, Rod is also affiliated with the Nashville Healthcare Council, Nashville Chamber of Commerce, and HealthTrust Performance Group. His work is celebrated in major publications for its significant community impact and industry influence.
